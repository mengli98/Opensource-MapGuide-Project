Opensource-MapGuide-Project
===========================
The goal of this project is to extend the functionality of the open-source software MapGuide to enable dynamical extraction of spatial data from MySQL database and automatic publication of data through MapGuide web service. To support better user interaction, I implement a web application to accompany the original MapGuide interactive viewer to allow users to register, login, and choose the geospatial data to synchronize with the MySQL database.

Platforms:
MapGuide Open Source 2.5.2,
MapGuide Maestro,
MySQL Database,
SQLyog

Programming Languages:
Java, JSP, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
MapGuide Java API 
Bootstrap API
